Files in this directory are:
- .cnf files in DIMACS format from the DIMACS Benchmark Instances of
SATLIB, as retrived from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html


- .out output files : for each <name>.cnf file, a <name>.out log file
  contains the output of a run of Psyche on this file. Standard
  output and error output are concatenated so that we see the reason
  why Psyche (in fact OCaml since Psyche itself does not output
  messages on the error output) exited without concluding if this is the
  case. Main examples are "out of memory error" but the standard mode
  of Psyche raise a "Stack_overflow" exception on g250-29.cnf in the
  gcp category.

- test_<cat>.sh : a script to run Psyche on every instance of the
  <name> category of problems of the DIMACS Benchmark Instances and
  produce the corresponding .out log files.
  Categories are :
  aim
  lran
  jnh
  dubois
  gcp
  parity
  ii
  hanoi
  bf
  ssa
  phole
  pret

- survey_<cat>.sh : a script to summarize the preformances of Psyche
  on the problems in the <cat> category. Produces a log file called
  <name>.txt. For the time being this log
  is very elementary: it contains one line per problem in the <name>
  category. Each line has the following structure:
  <name of the problem> | <number of variables> | <number of clauses>
  | <success status and time> | <error>
  The two last colomns are exclusive : either Psyche succeeded to
  conclude and the <error> column is empty, or it failed
  and the <success status and time> is empty.
  In the <success status and time> column, "Total success" means that
  Psyche proved that the problem is UNSAT, "Total failure" means that
  a proof tree has been constructed.
