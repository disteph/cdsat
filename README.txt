===================
COMPILING:

The source can be compiled with OCaml 4.02* (with ocamlbuild 0.4) and findlib
>= 1.6.2:

- Configuration: run

  ocaml setup.ml -configure
  
  The configuration will also be displayed on the standard
  output. The default configuration is set to native compilation, you can use
  ocaml setup.ml -configure --override is_native false
  or
  ocaml setup.ml -configure --override is_native true
  to switch. You can also edit setup.data to modify the settings.

- Compilation: run

  ocaml setup.ml -build

- Installation (optional):

  ocaml setup.ml -install 

  which installs the compiled executable at the location indicated at
  configuration time (default is /usr/local/bin/). This step may
  require admin roots.

- Uninstallation:

  ocaml setup.ml -uninstall

  This step may require admin roots.

- Clean up:

  ocaml setup.ml -distclean

- Oasis: 

  The files setup.ml (and myocamlbuild.ml) included in the
  distribution are automatically generated by OASIS (we use version
  0.4.6) from input file _oasis. If you have oasis installed on your
  machine, you may modify _oasis and regenerate setup.ml by the
  command oasis setup.

====================
API in html format

You can generate it by running:
oasis setup
ocaml setup.ml -configure
ocaml setup.ml -doc
ocaml setup.ml -install

===================
RUNNING PSYCHE:

If you did a local installation (without running 
'ocaml setup.ml -install'), a main.native executable file has been
created, at the root of the directory containing the sources of Psyche.

If you did go through the installation (running
'ocaml setup.ml -install'), you dispose of a

psyche

executable, installed in the directory specified in your configuration.

A command-line argument will be considered as the file name or
directory name to treat.  If no argument is given, the standard input
will be used.

Available options are:
  -no XXX forbids use of theory XXX
  -th XXX forces use of theory XXX
  -alltheories makes Psyche use all theories, except those specified by -no option
  -notheories makes Psyche use no theories, except those specified by -th option
  -fo selects the first-order sequent calculus mode
  -plugin XXX selects XXX as the main plugin (among async)
  -pluginG XXX selects XXX as the pure logic plugin (among naive, hint, dpll_pat, dpll_wl)
  -parser XXX authorises XXX among the parsers to try (among dimacs, smtlib2)
  -latex allows latex output
  -alphasort treats input files in alphabetical order (default is from smaller to bigger)
  -skipsat skips instances expected to be sat
  -skipunsat skips instances expected to be unsat
  -skipunprovable skips instances expected to be unprovable
  -skipprovable skips instances expected to be provable
  -skipunknown skips instances without any result expectation
  -nocuts disallows cuts
  -nodepol disallows depolarisation of literals
  -fair ensures fairness between formulae for focus
  -noweakenings disallows conflict analysis
  -debug XXX iii prints on stdout those debug messages whose tags contain XXX and whose level is at most iii
  -step waits for keystroke after printing each debug message (applies to latest -debug)
  -printrhs when debug printing allowed, prints right-hand sides of sequents
  -nomemo disallows memoisation
  -noalmo memoisation is done on exact match only
  -nounitpropagation disallows eager unit propagation in MyPatricia
  -restarts select a restart stratedy (from constant, arithmetic, geometric, exponential, luby, and none; default: none; DPLL_WL specific)
  -rsettings fine-tunes the restart strategy, specifying the initial restart threshold and a strategy-specific setting (defaults: 10 0; some strategies discard the second parameter; DPLL_WL specific)
  -plot prints large amounts of debug data, formatted for input to a plotting script
  -version prints version and exits
  -help  Display this list of options
  --help  Display this list of options
