===================

COMPILING:

The source can be compiled with OCaml 4.00 (with ocamlbuild) and findlib
1.3.3

ocaml setup.ml -configure
ocaml setup.ml -build

The file setup.ml is automatically generated by OASIS (we use version
0.3.0) from input file _oasis;
If you have oasis, you may modify _oasis and regenerate setup.ml by
the command
oasis setup
If you don't, then do not change setup.ml by hand

===================
RUNNING PSYCHE:

./main.native

If no argument is given, the examples written by hand in the parser
are treated, and printed in latex/output.tex 
Otherwise, you may give, as a command-line argument, a file to be
parsed, or a directory containing such files.


Alternatively:

./run.sh
runs ./main.native (with no argument), then pdflatex, then acroread

===================
You may install the program (as root):

ocaml setup.ml -install
