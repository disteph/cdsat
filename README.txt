Compiling (requires ocamlbuild):

ocaml setup.ml -configure
ocaml setup.ml -build

The file setup.ml is automatically generated by OASIS from input file
_oasis;
If you have oasis, you may modify _oasis and regenerate setup.ml by
the command
oasis setup
If you don't, then do not change setup.ml by hand

===================
Running the programme:

./main.native

If no argument is given, the small examples written by hand in main.ml
are treated, and printed in latex/output.tex
Otherwise, you may give, as an argument, a file in DIMACS format,
or a directory containing such files.


Alternatively:

./run.sh
runs ./main.native (with no argument), then pdflatex, then acroread

===================
You may install the program (as root):

ocaml setup.ml -install
