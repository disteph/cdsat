(* Main plugin, implementing the combination of decision procedures
with concurrency, as provided by Jane Street's Async library.

   This is a master-slaves architecture.

   Each slave thread runs the code written in worker.ml, controlling
   the (purely sequential) execution of a decision procedure, and
   exchanging messages with the master thread, whose code is below.  *)
